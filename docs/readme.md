# Docs

Here is where all the hard core documentation for the framework will live.

Hopefully there are topics you care about and provide you enough basic information to go on.

Feel free to join the [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/AlphaECS/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/AlphaECS/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=body_badge) chatroom and discuss any confusing bits.

There is also the [Unity Survival Shooter](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-tutorial) example project that's been completely redone using AlphaECS.
