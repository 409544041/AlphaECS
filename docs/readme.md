# Docs

Here is an attempt at documentation of the framework and use-cases.

Hopefully there are topics you care about and provide you enough basic information to go on, if now however feel free to join the 
gitter room and chat some more about it in there.

There are also a number of examples within the project folders you can just look over or check out and run yourself.
